                          <strong>Proof of work</strong> – Miners solve a
                          complex mathematical problem. The miner that solves
                          the problem first adds the block to the blockchain.
                          The network rewards the miner for doing so.

                          <strong>Proof of stake</strong> – Requires ownership,
                          or stake, in the cryptocurrency. The more tokens you
                          own, the more block creation power you have. Benefits:
                          eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs, runs on
                          a tiny fraction of the power, and it requires block
                          producers to have a stake in the network.

                          collectively approved by Steem stakeholders. Instead
                          of relying on proof of work to find blocks, the Steem
                          network actively schedules these accounts to improve
                          the time between blocks to 3 seconds.

                          On a technical level, the two networks rely on the
                          same model of a blockchain, but are built upon
                          different technologies and codebase. Steem is based on
                          a new state-of-the-art blockchain technology called
                          Graphene, which uses &quot;witnesses&quot; instead of
                          &quot;miners&quot; to produce blocks.

                          The &quot;delegated proof of stake&quot; model of
                          using witnesses instead of miners allows for greater
                          efficiency in block production. With BTC, 100% of the
                          new coins that are created are allocated to block
                          producers (miners). With the Steem blockchain, only
                          10% of the new coins are paid to block producers
                          (witnesses). The other 90% of new STEEM coins are
                          awarded to content producers, curators, and Steem
                          Power holders.
